**!UPDATE**: We have released several new pretrained scGPT checkpoints. Please see the [Pretrained scGPT checkpoints](#pretrained-scGPT-checkpoints) section for more details.

**[2023.09.05]** We have release a new feature for reference mapping samples to a custom reference dataset or to all the millions of cells collected from CellXGene! With the help of the [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) library, we achieved a great time and memory efficiency. The index of over 33 millions cells only takes less than 1GB of memory and the similarity search takes less than **1 second for 10,000 query cells on GPU**. Please see the [Reference mapping tutorial](https://github.com/bowang-lab/scGPT/blob/main/tutorials/Tutorial_Reference_Mapping.ipynb) for more details.

### Online apps

scGPT is now available at the following online apps as well, so you can get started simply with your browser!

- Run the [cell annotation app](https://app.superbio.ai/apps/274?id=64d205cb980ff714de831ee0) and the [GRN inference app](https://app.superbio.ai/apps/270?id=64b804fb823bc93b64c10a76) with cloud gpus. Thanks to the [Superbio.ai](https://app.superbio.ai/) team for helping create and host the interactive tools.

## Installation

scGPT works with Python >= 3.7.13 and R >=3.6.1. Please make sure you have the correct version of Python and R installed pre-installation.

scGPT is available on PyPI. To install scGPT, run the following command:

```bash
pip install torch==1.13.0
pip install scgpt "flash-attn<1.0.5"
# As of 2023.09, pip install may not run with new versions of the google orbax package, if you encounter related issues, please use the following command instead:
# pip install scgpt "flash-attn<1.0.5" "orbax<0.1.8"
```

[Optional] We recommend using [wandb](https://wandb.ai/) for logging and visualization.

```bash
pip install wandb
```

For developing, we are using the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager. To install Poetry, follow the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

```bash
$ git clone this-repo-url
$ cd scGPT
$ poetry install
```

**Note**: The `flash-attn` dependency usually requires specific GPU and CUDA version. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [flash-attn](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention/tree/main) repository for installation instructions. For now, May 2023, we recommend using CUDA 11.7 and flash-attn<1.0.5 due to various issues reported about installing new versions of flash-attn.

## Using the Docker Image for scGPT

By using the `scGPT Docker image`, you can bypass the complexities of manual package installation, ensuring a consistent deployment environment. Included in this repository is a Dockerfile that lets you craft a container for the project; you have the choice to either build this image on your own or conveniently pull it from Docker Hub.

### Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image from the provided `Dockerfile`, run the following command from the root directory of this repository:

```bash
docker build -t scgpt:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

### Pulling the Docker Image from Docker Hub

If you don't want to build the image yourself, you can pull it directly from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull xueerchen/scgpt:0.1.7
docker tag xueerchen/scgpt:0.1.7 scgpt:latest
```

### Running the Docker Container

Once you have the image (either by building it or pulling it), you can start a container with:

```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -it scgpt:latest bash
```

Please note: When running the Docker container, ensure you mount any necessary folders using the -v option to access them inside the container.

## Pretrained scGPT Model Zoo

Here is the list of pretrained models. Please find the links for downloading the checkpoint folders. We recommend using the `whole-human` model for most applications by default. If your fine-tuning dataset shares similar cell type context with the training data of the organ-specific models, these models can usually demonstrate competitive performance as well.

| Model name                | Description                                             | Download                                                                                     |
